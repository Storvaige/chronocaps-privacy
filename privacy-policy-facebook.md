# Privacy Policy – Facebook Authentication Integration

**Effective Date:** 6th May 2025  
**Last Updated:** 6th May 2025

Our mobile application (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) uses Facebook Login as an authentication method to simplify user access and improve the user experience. This section explains how we collect, use, and protect information obtained through Facebook Authentication.

## 1. Information We Collect

When you choose to log in using Facebook, we may receive the following information from your Facebook account, depending on your privacy settings and Facebook’s API:

- Your public profile (e.g., name, profile picture, age range, gender, and other information you make publicly available)
- Your email address (if shared)
- Your Facebook ID

We do **not** have access to your Facebook password or any private messages.

## 2. How We Use the Information

We use the data collected through Facebook Login to:

- Authenticate your identity and grant access to the App
- Personalize your experience (e.g., by displaying your name or profile photo)
- Facilitate account creation and login across multiple devices
- Improve our services and maintain app security

We do not use this information for marketing purposes unless you give explicit consent.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** sell, rent, or trade your Facebook information with third parties. However, we may share the collected data in the following situations:

- With service providers who assist in operating our app (under strict confidentiality agreements)
- If required by law, subpoena, or other legal processes
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or others

## 4. Your Control and Choices

You may disconnect your Facebook account from our App at any time through the Facebook settings page or in our App’s account settings (if available). Upon disconnection, we will no longer receive any new data from Facebook.

## 5. Security of Your Information

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We encourage you to use strong passwords and take steps to protect your account credentials.
